Documentation for Warmup Assignment 1
=====================================

+------------------------+
| BUILD & RUN (Required) |
+------------------------+

Replace "(Comments?)" below with the command the grader should use to compile
your program (it should simply be "make" or "make warmup1"; minor variation is
also fine).

    To compile your code, the grader should type: Make sure you are in the correct directory, and type the command "make" to generate the executable files. Then type the command ./warmup1 sort tfile to generate the output for tfile already present in the folder. To make manual entry use the command ./warmup1 sort. To remove the executables use make clean.

If you have additional instruction for the grader, replace "(Comments?)" with your
instruction (or with the word "none" if you don't have additional instructions):

    Additional instructions for building/running this assignment: None.

Segmentation faults : 0 pts(The segmentation fault errors simulated for my cases were handled appropriately).
Separate compilation : 0 pts(Did not use any seperate compilation).
Malformed input : 0 pts(Handled all cases appropriately).
Too slow : 0 pts(Runs within the given time constraints).
Bad commandline : 0 pts(Handled the given cases appropriately).

| BUGS / TESTS TO SKIP |
+----------------------+

Are there are any tests mentioned in the grading guidelines test suite that you
know that it's not working and you don't want the grader to run it at all so you
won't get extra deductions, please replace "(Comments?)" below with your list.
(Of course, if the grader won't run such tests in the plus points section, you
will not get plus points for them; if the garder won't run such tests in the
minus points section, you will lose all the points there.)  If there's nothing
the grader should skip, please replace "(Comments?)" with "none".

Please skip the following tests: None.
